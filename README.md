# Linked List Repository

This repository contains various implementations and operations for **Linked Lists** in C++/JavaScript (adjust the language based on your implementation). It is designed to help learners and developers understand how to use linked lists effectively in data structures and algorithms.

## Features

- **Singly Linked List**: Basic implementation with functions for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Includes functions to navigate in both directions, allowing insertion and deletion from both ends.
- **Circular Linked List**: Operations in a circular format where the last node points back to the head.
- **Complex Operations**: Search, sorting, and reversing linked lists.

## Installation
